# Mac Notes.app Exporter

Your last straw to save your data from Notes.app.

Just click and open the program `MacNotesExporter.command`.

The result will be saved in a file named `Notes-1.html` beside the program.

If any error is found, the message is saved in `Notes-1.txt`.

Note:

*   This program does not export the attachments in your notes.
*   Only tested on Mac OS 10.10 (Yosemite) and 10.11 (El Capitan).
*   It may work on newer systems but some [reported] that some notes were missing.
